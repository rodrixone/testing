<center><p>Days when<br>
We'd fight, we'd fight 'til I would give in<br>
Yeah, perfect disasters<br>
We were reaching, reaching for the rafters<br></p>

<p>And on most of the days we were searching for ways<br>
To get up and get out of the town that we were raised, yeah, Cause we were done<br>
I remember, we were sleeping in cars<br>
We were searching for OZ<br>
We were burning cigars<br>
With white plastics tips 'til we saw the sun<br>
And we said crazy things like<br></p>

<p>I refuse to look back thinking days were better<br>
Just because they're younger days<br>
I don't know what's 'round the corner<br>
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change<br>
Back when we were kids<br>
Swore we would never die<br>
You and me were kids<br>
Swear that we'll never die<br></p>

<p>Lights down<br>
And we drive and we're drivin' just to get out<br>
Yeah, perfect disasters<br>
Yeah we were swinging, swinging from the rafters<br></p>

<p>Hey, we were dancing in cars<br>
We were looking for ours<br>
We were naming the stars<br>
After people we knew 'til we had to go<br>
And we were saying things like<br></p>

<p>I refuse to look back thinking days were better<br>
Just because they're younger days<br>
I don't know what's 'round the corner<br>
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change<br>
Back when we were kids<br>
Swore we would never die<br>
You and me were kids<br>
Swear that we'll never die<br></p>

<p>Nights when we kept dancing<br>
Changing all our plans and<br>
Making every day a holiday<br>
Feel the years start burning<br>
City lights they're turning<br>
Something 'bout this feels the same<br></p>

<p>Back when we were kids<br>
Swore we would never die<br>
You and me were kids<br>
Swear that we'll never die<br>
I refuse to look back thinking days were better<br>
Just because they're younger days<br>
I don't know what's 'round the corner<br>
Way I feel right now I swear we'll never change<br>
You and me were kids </p></dd></center>

<p>When the days are cold<br>
And the cards all fold<br>
And the saints we see<br>
Are all made of gold</p>
<p>When your dreams all fail<br>
And the ones we hail<br>
Are the worst of all<br>
And the blood’s run stale</p>
<p>I want to hide the truth<br>
I want to shelter you<br>
But with the beast inside<br>
There’s nowhere we can hide</p>
<p>No matter what we breed<br>
We still are made of greed<br>
This is my kingdom come<br>
This is my kingdom come</p>
<p>When you feel my heat<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
Don’t get too close<br>
It’s dark inside<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
It’s where my demons hide</p>
<p>At the curtain’s call<br>
It’s the last of all<br>
When the lights fade out<br>
All the sinners crawl<br>
So they dug your grave<br>
And the masquerade<br>
Will come calling out<br>
At the mess you made</p>
<p>Don’t want to let you down<br>
But I am hell bound<br>
Though this is all for you<br>
Don’t want to hide the truth<br>
No matter what we breed<br>
We still are made of greed<br>
This is my kingdom come<br>
This is my kingdom come</p>
<p>When you feel my heat<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
Don’t get too close<br>
It’s dark inside<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
It’s where my demons hide</p>
<p>They say it's what you makev
I say it's up to fate<br>
It's woven in my soul<br>
I need to let you go<br>
Your eyes, they shine so bright<br>
I want to save that light<br>
I can't escape this now<br>
Unless you show me how</p>
<p>When you feel my heat<br>
Look into my eyes<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
Don’t get too close<br>
It’s dark inside<br>
It’s where my demons hide<br>
It’s where my demons hide</p>

<p>Come to decide that the things that I tried<br>
Were in my life just to get high on<br>
When I sit alone come get a little more known<br>
But I need more than myself this time<br>
Strip from the road to the sea to the sky<br>
And I do believe what we rely on<br>
When I lay it on<br>
Come get to play it on<br>
All my life to sacrifice<br>
</p>
<p>Hey oh listen what I say oh<br>
I got your
Hey oh listen what I say oh </p>
<p>When will I know that I really can?t go<br>
To the well one more time to decide on<br>
When it?s killing me<br>
When will I really see<br>
All that I need to look inside<br>
Come to believe that I better not leave<br>
Before I get my chance to ride<br>
When it?s killing me<br>
When will I really see<br>
All that I need to look inside<br>

<p>The sun goes down<br>
The stars comes out<br>
And all that counts<br>
Is here and now<br>
My universe<br>
Will never be the same<br>
I'm glad you came </p>
<p>You've cast a spell on me, spell on me<br>
You hit me like the sky fell on my, fell on me<br>
And I've decided you look well on me, well on me<br>
So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me </p>
<p>Turn the lights out now<br>
Now I'll take you by the hand<br>
Hand you another drink<br>
Drink it if you can<br>
Can you spend a little time?<br>
Time is slipping away<br>
Away from us so stay<br>
Stay with me, I can make<br>
Make you glad you came<br>
